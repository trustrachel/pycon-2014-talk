PyCon Talk 
==========

TITLE
------
Developing Flask Extensions [need less boring title]

CATEGORY
---------

Best Practices/Patterns

DURATION
--------

30 minutes

DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can create a web application with Flask in seven lines of code. What happens when your app grows to thousands? How do you create reusable, shareable libraries?

We'll use a real but very simple extension I created (Flask-FeatureFlags) to look at the different ways you can hook into Flask applications. 


AUDIENCE
--------
Users of Flask or web developers curious about its capabilities. 

PYTHON LEVEL
------------

Intermediate

OBJECTIVES
----------

Users of Flask will learn how to extend it and make shareable, reuseable libraries. Application developers not familiar with Flask get an idea of its capabilities.

This would be my first time speaking at a conference like PyCon. Iâ€™ve spoken at my company a few times and at PyLadies events. I'll have the opportunity to speak at several user groups beforehand.
