PyCon Talk 
==========

TITLE
------
Developing Flask Extensions [need less boring title]

CATEGORY
---------

Best Practices/Patterns

DURATION
--------

30 minutes

DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can create a web application with Flask in seven lines of code. What happens when your app grows to thousands? How do you create reusable, shareable libraries?

We'll use a real but very simple extension I created (Flask-FeatureFlags) to look at the different ways you can hook into Flask applications. 


AUDIENCE
--------
Users of Flask or web application developers curious about its capabilities. 

PYTHON LEVEL
------------

Intermediate

OBJECTIVES
----------

Users of Flask will learn how to extend it and make shareable, reuseable libraries. Application developers not familiar with Flask get an idea of its capabilities for future projects.

	* topics covered:
		- Using signals to hook into request lifecycle
		- Storing functions in the global variable g
		- Decorators to customize view behavior
		- Customizing Jinja
		- Installing your extension
		- Python 3 support

ADDITIONAL NOTES
-----------------

* Flask-FeatureFlags is open source: https://github.com/trustrachel/Flask-FeatureFlags

This would be my first time speaking at a conference like PyCon. Iâ€™ve spoken at my company a few times and at PyLadies events. I'll have the opportunity to speak at several user groups beforehand.
